This project compared manual methods and machine learning approaches for predicting protein secondary structure from sequence identity, focusing on how context window (frame) size impacts accuracy. Using amino acid propensities and a decision tree classifier, we evaluated how local sequence context influences classification performance, with manual methods achieving higher accuracy but at a much higher computational cost. Our findings highlight both the promise and the limitations of context-windowâ€“based models, underscoring the need for more nuanced approaches in computational protein structure prediction.
